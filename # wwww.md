## **Identifying and Defining** 

**Identifying a need:** Im making a game for kids aged 5 and above that struggle with developing mastery skills without putting in the work. This game is designed to teach kids that you cannot reach a mastery skill or become really good at something without going through the bare basics and many hardships. 

 ***Brainstorming:***

WALL JUMPS?
graphics and storyline kind of inspired by soul knight, but slightly different
include magical weapons and spells 
movements including walking, dash, and then a special skill that you can level up
the objective is to protect this special teleportation device that will send you
after finishing a level or a wave, depending on how hard the level or wave was, gets a timer that will help you prepare for thje next wave, but after you go into a portal, which will take you to another level, then the main timer will pause, and it will be like a platform game

***storyline:***

you have been traveling the stars in search for a habitable planet and you found one. But your starship crashes into the planet. The things that live there are sentient and they want to kill you. There are different waves of different mythical creatures that want you dead. Your spaceship is repairing itself, but all you have is normal earth military equipment to protect yourself, but after you kill some monsters you can make special magical weapons that are better. After you kill all the waves a boss fight comes, and then after you kill the boss, there's a portal that you can go through to get more materials to repair your starship. By going into different portals, itâ€™ll help you unlock different skills. 

**Need:** To improve eye-hand coordination skills in young children aged 5 and above, as well as teaching them about hardships and improving their problem solving skills.

**Problem statement:** Children aged 5 and above are often kids who find themselves still learning about what they want to achieve in their lifetime. However, as they go on their journey of self discovery, they find themselves struggling to learn new things, especially when hardships come their way. My action-dungeon course game requires players to go through different problems such as fighting monsters, navigating through mazes, protecting objectives and more. This will be done through controlling the character and navigating the game in order to solve different problems, and as they all get harder, the players can use previous knowledge from levels to unlock new levels and solve harder but similar problems, much like in real life. 

**Skill Development:** To develop the skills needed to make the game, I would complete this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww

**Compatibility Requirements**

- The game must be compatible on PC and web browsers, as this is a game designed to be controlled using a keyboard.
- However, in order for the game to be compatible on mobile (android and iOS devices) then touch controls will be made for interaction.

**Scalability Requirements**

- As my game grows, certain features will be adapated into my game, such as new weapons, new levels, new storylines and multiple players.

**Relaibility and Availability**

- The game should be available 99% of the time, with error handling for when the game does seem to randomly crash. If this does happen, then the game will load the last version of the game that has been saved.
